I'm Blake, a second-year PhD student in computer science at Purdue University!

I am broadly interested in cryptography and quantum computation, and I'm more specifically interested in time-space/query-space trade-offs in these settings. At Purdue, my research is on the classical and post-quantum security of memory-hard functions with my advisor [Jeremiah Blocki](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jblocki/). I intern at the Quantum Algorithms and Applications Collaboratory <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sandia.gov/quantum/quaac/">(QuAAC)</a> team at Sandia National Laboratories, where I'm studying the quantum query complexity of various graph problems. 

I'm grateful to be supported by the Ross Fellowship at Purdue for the 2021-2022 academic year, the Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship from Fall 2022, and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (NSF-GRF) from Fall 2023.

Prior to joining Purdue, I studied computer science and mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin as a Ronald E. McNair Scholar. At UT I worked with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/plaxton/index.html">Greg Plaxton</a> on three-dimensional stable marriage and conducted research as a part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/">Building-Wide Intelligence Project</a> with <a target="_blank" href="http://justinhart.net/">Justin Hart</a>.
