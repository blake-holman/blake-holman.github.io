I'm Blake, a first-year PhD student in computer science at Purdue University!

I am broadly interested in cryptography and quantum computation. Currently, I'm researching the classical and post-quantum security of memory-hard functions with my advisor [Jeremiah Blocki](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jblocki/). This summer I'll be joining the Fundamental Algorithmic Research for Quantum Computing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sandia.gov/quantum/quantum-information-sciences/projects/fundamental-algorithmic-research-for-quantum-computing/">(FAR-QC)</a> team at Sandia National Laboratories. I'm grateful to be supported by the Ross Fellowship at Purdue for the 2021-2022 academic year and the Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship starting Fall 2022.

Prior to joining Purdue, I studied computer science and mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin as a Ronald E. McNair Scholar. At UT I worked with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/plaxton/index.html">Greg Plaxton</a> on three-dimensional stable marriage and conducted research as a part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/">Building-Wide Intelligence Project</a> with <a target="_blank" href="http://justinhart.net/">Justin Hart</a>.
